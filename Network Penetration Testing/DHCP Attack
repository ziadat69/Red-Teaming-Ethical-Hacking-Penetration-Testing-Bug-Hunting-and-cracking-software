DHCP Starvation Attack:

A DHCP Starvation attack can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack. 
To perform this attack, the attacker sends tons of bogus DHCP Discover messages with spoofed source MAC addresses. 
The DHCP server tries to respond to all these bogus messages, and as a result, the pool of IP addresses used by the DHCP
server is depleted. Hence, a legitimate user won’t be able to get an IP address via DHCP. This results in a DoS attack. 
Furthermore, the attacker can set up a rogue DHCP server to assign IP addresses to legitimate users. This rogue server can also provide the gateway router and DNS server to users. 
Now, all the network traffic can be routed via the attacker’s machine, and this is nothing but the MITM attac



Implementation using Yersinia:

Yersinia is a tool for performing layer 2 attacks. It takes advantage of weaknesses in existing protocols to launch a variety of attacks. 

Step 1: You can install Yersinia on Ubuntu 20.04 using the following command:

--> sudo apt-get install yersinia

--> sudo yersinia -G

Step 2:
The source IP address is set to 0.0.0.0 as new users send packets using this IP address before they are assigned an 
IP address by the DHCP server and the destination IP address is set to 255.255.255.255 as the DHCP discover packet 
is broadcasted in the entire network

Step 3:  select Wlo1
 Next, we need to select the appropriate interface. 
For simulation purposes, lo that is the loopback interface was selected. 
This setting will send DHCP to discover packets to the loopback address. 
In short, localhost is the DHCP server in this case.

Step 4: Next, we need to select the type of attack that is “sending Discover packet”. 
You can observe that the DoS checkbox next to it is checked since it is a type of DoS.
