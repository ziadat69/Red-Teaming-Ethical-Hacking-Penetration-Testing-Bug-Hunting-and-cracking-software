After going through six phases of the attack, "Megatron" can finally achieve his goals, which means taking action on the original objectives. With hands-on keyboard access, the attacker can achieve the following: 

** Collect the credentials from users.
** Perform privilege escalation (gaining elevated access like domain administrator access from a workstation by exploiting the misconfiguration).
** Internal reconnaissance (for example, an attacker gets to interact with internal software to find its vulnerabilities).
** Lateral movement through the company's environment.
** Collect and exfiltrate sensitive data.
** Deleting the backups and shadow copies. Shadow Copy is a Microsoft technology that can create backup copies, snapshots of computer files, or volumes. 
** Overwrite or corrupt data.
