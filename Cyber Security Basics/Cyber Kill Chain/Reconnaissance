Reconnaissance is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. The reconnaissance phase is the planning phase for the adversaries.

OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance. OSINT is the first step an attacker needs to complete to carry out the further phases of an attack. The attacker needs to study the victim by collecting every available piece of information on the company and its employees, such as the company's size, email addresses, phone numbers from publicly available resources to determine the best target for the attack. 

You can also find out more about OSINT from this Varonis article, "What is OSINT?"

Let's look at it from the attacker's perspective, who initially doesn't know what company he wants to attack. 

Here is the scenario: A malicious attacker who names himself "Megatron" decides to conduct a very sophisticated attack that he has been planning out for years; he has been studying and researching different tools and techniques that could help him get to the last phase of the Cyber Kill Chain. But first, he needs to start from the Reconnaissance phase.

In order to operate in this phase, the attacker would need to conduct OSINT.  Let's have a look at Email harvesting.

Email harvesting is the process of obtaining email addressesfrom public, paid, or free services. An attacker can use email-address harvesting for a phishing attack (a type of social-engineering attack used to steal sensitive data, including login credentials and credit card numbers). The attacker will have a big arsenal of tools available for reconnaissance purposes. Here are some of them:

** theHarvester - other than gathering emails, this tool is also capable of gathering names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using multiple public data sources 

** Hunter.io - this is  an email hunting tool that will let you obtain contact information associated with the domain

** OSINT Framework - OSINT Framework provides the collection of OSINT tools based on various categories
