After getting persistence and executing the malware on the victim's machine, "Megatron" opens up the C2 (Command and Control) channel through the malware to remotely control and manipulate the victim. This term is also known as C&C or C2 Beaconing as a type of malicious communication between a C&C server and malware on the infected host. The infected host will consistently communicate with the C2 server; that is also where the beaconing term came from. 

The compromised endpoint would communicate with an external server set up by an attacker to establish a command & control channel. After establishing the connection,  the attacker has full control of the victim's machine. Until recently, IRC (Internet Relay Chat) was the traditional C2 channel used by attackers. This is no longer the case, as modern security solutions can easily detect malicious IRC traffic. 

The most common C2 channels used by adversaries nowadays:

The protocols HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443 - this type of beaconing blends the malicious traffic with the legitimate traffic and can help the attacker evade firewalls.  
DNS (Domain Name Server). The infected machine makes constant DNS requests to the DNS server that belongs to an attacker, this type of C2 communication is also known as DNS Tunneling.
Important to note that an adversary or another compromised host can be the owner of the C2 infrastructure.
